handle authentication failure

register user in db
password change 
register role 
asssign role to user
retrive role after authentication in sub

based on domain choose authentication backend as ldap or db 

client for 
	a. sending the auth info and getting token 
	b. connecting to other micro services using the token

other microservoce to have client for connecting to auth service to verify the token 

force microservices to validate token before processing api request

====================================
 
Client to Microservice
Step1: C1--> T1 : 	C1 provide Domain name, user name , password and intended api operation request for token 
Step2: T1-->C1 : 	a.T1 checks the user name and password against LDAP if domain is ITC else against local database. 
b. After matching the username and password it retrieves the roles / access level of the user
 Status: Done
c. Generates the token with username and role encrypted within token
 Status: Done
d. Also returns whole URL path of intended API operation (http://FQDN:port/<Api>)

Step3: C1--> M1 	C1 receive the token and issue a fresh request to M1 url path using the received token / along with the token. 
Step4: M1-->T1 		M1 calls T1 to unencrypt the token and retrieves access/ role information
Status: Done
Step5: M1-->C1 		return result

***END POINT FOR USER MANAGEMENT ON T1 DB***
Step1: Read from settings.ini, token admin section about the token admin username and encrypted password
Status: Done
Step2: Create a CLI utility to register token admin in T1 DB
Status: Done
Step3: Create an endpoint allows admin to create/update/delete a user using http API operation with token authentication
In summary,  user curd operation end point to have a check which allows operation only if the user name is admin and role is admin . the retrieval if role and usr id  is done using the  token authentication module as described I the section above
Status: WIP. 'Create' Done 

Microservice to Microservice communication step by step
M1-->T1 Request for token against M2 
T1--> M1 Provide token
M1-->M2 M1 connect to M2 with token
M2--> T1 M2 calls T1 to verify the token and retirves access
 M2--> M1 return result
